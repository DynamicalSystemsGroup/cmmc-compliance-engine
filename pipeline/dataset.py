"""Named-graph quadstore helpers.

The runtime uses an rdflib.Dataset with eight named graphs sized to match
how Flexo MMS partitions projects/branches/refs. Named-graph IRIs are
exported as constants by ontology.prefixes (G_ONTOLOGY, G_STRUCTURAL,
G_EVIDENCE, ...). This module gives the runtime a small surface over the
Dataset:

- create_dataset()             build a Dataset with prefixes bound and
                               default_union=True so existing SPARQL
                               queries continue to work without GRAPH
                               clauses.
- graph_for(ds, layer)         return the named-graph view for that
                               layer; writes go to the corresponding
                               quad slot.
- load_into(ds, layer, path)   parse a TTL file into that layer.
- triples_by_graph(ds)         {graph_iri: count} — sanity / display.
- export_trig(ds, path)        serialize the full quadstore as TriG.
- export_union_turtle(ds, p)   serialize the union view as flat Turtle
                               (back-compat with the flat-graph export
                               that downstream tools consume).
